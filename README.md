MemHack <short for Memory Hacking Module> allows you to hack any part of the memory dynamically using simple functions.

You may hack the mod dll, to directly alter and interface with the mod.
You may also hack the engine dll, and directly interface with that, allowing you to do things even mods can't do.
You can also hack freeform, with no base address.

Allows for simple retreival and patching of memory, as well as a few helper functions. Note: You can, and probably will, crash HL1 with this. Be careful.

This module can emulate any CSHACK native.

To add:
Hooking and calling functions

Credit to: DS for his awsome code. You asked for someone to clean up the code; I did ^^
